## Data

For the sake of size limitation, the raw data has been uploaded on [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4299908).

[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.4299908.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4299908)


In this repo you can find the followind data:

1. [`collected-repositories.csv`](collected-repositories.csv) - the 1050 collected repositories.

2. [`selected-repositories.csv`](selected-repositories.csv) - the 200 repositories that satisfied the inclusion criteria in paper's Table 1.

3. [`analyzed-repositories.csv`](analyzed-repositories.csv) - the 104 repositories used to answer the RQs.

4. [`fixing-commits-validation.csv`](fixing-commits-validation.csv) - sample of manually assessed defect-fixing commits. The complete list of defect-fixing commits is available on Zenodo.

5. [`szz-validation.csv`](szz-validation.csv) - sample of manually assessed defect-inducing commits. The complete list of defect-introducing commits is available on Zenodo.

6. [`rq1.csv`](rq1.csv) - data collected to answer RQ1 (Techniques performance).

7. [`rq2.csv`](rq2.csv) - data collected to answer RQ2 (Metrics performance).

8. [`rq3.json`](rq3.json) - data collected to answer RQ3 (Recursive Feature Elimination).



## Kaggle
On kaggle is the dataset containing the data to build the models. [Go to Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/stefadp/ansibledefectsprediction/) or [download](https://www.kaggle.com/stefadp/ansibledefectsprediction/download) the dataset.


The [kernels](https://www.kaggle.com/stefadp/ansibledefectsprediction/kernels?sortBy=hotness&group=everyone&pageSize=20&datasetId=591542) are divided in four groups:

* `rq1/<owner>/<repository>` - used for RQ1.
* `tse2020/rq2/<owner>/<repository>` - used for RQ2.
* `tse2020/rq3/<owner>/<repository>` - used for RQ3.
* `tse2020/add/<owner>/<repository>` - used for an additional analysis of RQ3.



## Tool Suite

The **RADON Framework for IaC Defect Prediction** is available on [Github](https://github.com/radon-h2020/radon-defect-prediction-api).
Below the tools we used to build it.


1. `IaC Github Repositories Collector` - To collect active repositories. 
See on [Github](https://github.com/radon-h2020/radon-repositories-collector).

2. `Repository Scorer` - To collect repository metrics based on best engineering practices. 
See on [Github](https://github.com/radon-h2020/radon-repository-scorer).

3. `IaC Repository Miner` - To mine repositories and collect product, delta, and process metrics.
See on [Github](https://github.com/radon-h2020/radon-repository-miner).
 
    3.1. `AnsibleMetrics` - To extract product metrics for Ansible.
    See on [Github](https://github.com/radon-h2020/radon-ansible-metrics).
 
    3.1. `PyDriller` - To analyze commit history and extract process metrics.
    See on [Github](https://github.com/ishepard/pydriller).

4. `IaC Defect Predictor` - To build and evaluate models. See on [Github](https://github.com/radon-h2020/radon-defuse).
